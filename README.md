## ðŸš€ Overview
Trips & Travel.Com aims to expand its customer base by introducing new holiday packages. Currently, the company offers five package types: Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, and King. An analysis of last year's data revealed that only 18% of customers purchased a package, with high marketing costs due to random customer outreach.

To optimize marketing efforts and reduce costs, the company is launching a new **Wellness Tourism Package**, which focuses on travel experiences that promote health and well-being. This project leverages available customer data to improve marketing efficiency and predict package purchases.
